# Friend_Network_Analysis

This project's focus is to visualize a network of employees at a hypothetical company. The goal is to find if there is a correlation between shared favorite movies and the strength of the relationship between employees that share a favorite movie.

A total of eight employees, they were asked to choose 3 movies that they consider to be their favorite. These choices are stored in the file Employee_Movie_Choices.txt.

A second file, Employee_Relationships.txt, has data on the relationships between different coworkers.

The relationship score has value of -100 (Enemies) to +100 (Best Friends). A value of zero means the two employees haven't interacted or are indifferent.

Both files are tab delimited.
